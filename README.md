# üè≠ Pneumatic Cylinder Sorting System ‚Äì Siemens S7-1200 (TIA Portal, LAD)

This project is a **pneumatic cylinder sorting station** built with Siemens **S7-1200 PLC** and programmed in **TIA Portal** using **Ladder Logic (LAD)**. The system handles a continuous flow of plastic-encased cylinders, some of which contain metal. Based on sensor readings, the system sorts and directs these cylinders to the appropriate destination truck using a series of pneumatic actuators, sensors, and logic control.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Features

- **Feeder Mechanism**: A pressure-based actuator feeds stacked cylinders onto the conveyor.
- **Metal Detection**: Metal sensor above the conveyor detects if the current cylinder contains metal.
- **Sorting Logic**: After a configurable delay, cylinders with metal are pushed off the conveyor.
- **Redundancy Tracking**: Up to 6 timestamped entries are maintained to handle conveyor stops and queued metal cylinders.
- **End of Line Detection**:
  - **Presence Sensor**: Stops the conveyor when a cylinder reaches the end.
  - **Color Sensor**: Detects if the cylinder is white to determine which truck it should be routed to.
- **Pneumatic Arm**: 
  - Moves between conveyor and destination truck.
  - Can lower and use suction to lift and release cylinders.
  - Uses sensors for accurate position detection.
- **Control Panel**:
  - Start and stop buttons.
  - Green and yellow signal lights for status indication.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To simulate or deploy this project:

1. Open the `.ap19` project file in **TIA Portal** (tested with TIA Portal V19+).
2. Connect to a Siemens **S7-1200 PLC** (compatible CPU recommended: e.g., CPU 1214C).
3. Ensure all I/O addresses are correctly mapped to your hardware setup.
4. Run the program and test the workflow using the demo workstation.

## üìå Notes

- Actuators rely on an external **compressed air source**.
- Make sure safety mechanisms are in place before running the physical system.
- The system can be extended with more sensors or vision systems for advanced sorting.
